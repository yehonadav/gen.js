# gen.js (currently in a closed beta)
GEN JS is NEXT JS based, ready to go components.  
With intent of building applications modularly.  
On one hand enabling a service is as simple as a 1 liner.  
On the other hand every service can be drilled down and configured.  

The aim of this project is to  
* reduce: code duplication, copy pasting and legacy hell between projects.
* rely on best practices while keeping a high development speed
* confidense in well tested & documented code
